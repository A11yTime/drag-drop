# Drag and Drop functionality accessiblity Considerations
#### Based on WCAG 2.2 AA 
* All functionality that uses a dragging movement for operation can be achieved by a single pointer without dragging, unless dragging is essential or the functionality is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.
* This requirement applies to web content that interprets pointer actions (i.e. this does not apply to actions that are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).
## Terminology
* role="alert" verbose the  drag and drop activity
* tabindex="0" make functionality available with keyboard.
